Pay-API website built fromt designs available at frontendmentor.io

### About this project

This was a front-end development challange to build a mock website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I didn't use any frameworks for this project as I want to demonstrate my understanding of CSS and Flexbox and Grid layout systems. This a fully responsive website built to three widths for mobile, tablet and desktop. The designs were provided in a .sketch file which I imported into Adobe XD to create the website from.

The challenge stated that users should be able to: 

* View the optimal layout for each page depdnding on the device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements
* Receive error messages when the contact form is submitted with incomplete information
